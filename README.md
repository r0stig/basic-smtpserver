NodeJS powered SMTP-server
================

A basic SMTP server powered by Node.js, can be used as a local mail server for development or a skeleton for a more advanced mail server.

Clone the repository by:
> git clone git@github.com:r0stig/basic-smtpserver

Start the server by typing:
> $ nodejs app.js

Change hostname and portnumber in dep/config.js, if you want to use port 25 you might need to be root:
> sudo nodejs app.js
